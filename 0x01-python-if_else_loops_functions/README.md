# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* Why Python programming is awesome
* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the `while` and `for` loops
* How is Python’s `for` different from `C`‘s?
* How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
* How to use `else` clauses on loops
* What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
* How to use `range`
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does return a function that does not use any `return` statement
* Scope of variables

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

# Requirements
## Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## C Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` `-pedantic` `-std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

Tasks table

| Task Name  | File Name | Description |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing | `0-positive_or_negative.py`  | Print whether the number stored in the variable number |
| 1. The last digit | `1-last_digit.py` | Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number |
| 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game | `2-print_alphabet.py` | Print the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase |
| 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off | `3-print_alphabt.py` | Print ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, except q and e |
| 4. Hexadecimal printing | `4-print_hexa.py` | Print all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal |
| 5. 00...99 | `5-print_comb2.py` | Print numbers from `0` to `99` |
| 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need | `6-print_comb3.py` | Print all possible different combinations of two digits |
| 7. islower | `7-islower.py` | Check for lowercase character |
| 8. To uppercase | `8-uppercase.py` | Print a string in uppercase followed by a new line |
| 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important | `9-print_last_digit.py` | Print the last digit of a number |
| 10. a + b | `10-add.py` | Add two integers and returns the result |
| 11. a ^ b | `11-pow.py` | Compute `a` to the power of `b` and return the value |
| 12. Fizz Buzz | `12-fizzbuzz.py` | Print numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space |
| 13. Insert in sorted linked list | `13-insert_number.c, lists.h` | Inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list |
| 14. Smile in the mirror | `100-print_tebahpla.py` | Print the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order |
| 15. Remove at position | `101-remove_char_at.py` | Create a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` |
| 16. ByteCode -> Python #2 | `102-magic_calculation.py` | The python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c)` |
