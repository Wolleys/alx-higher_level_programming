# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are sets and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionaries and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate over a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What are the map, reduce and filter functions

# Requirements
## Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
