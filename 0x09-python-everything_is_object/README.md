# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General

* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
