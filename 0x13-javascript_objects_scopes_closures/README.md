# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to create an object in JavaScript
* What `this` means
