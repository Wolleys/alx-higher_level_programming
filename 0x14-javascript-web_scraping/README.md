# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

# Requirements
# General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS` using `node` (version 10.14.x)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should be `semistandard` compliant. Rules of [Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* You are not allowed to use `var`

# More Info
## Install Node 10
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Install semi-standard
[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)
```
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Install request module and use it
[Documentation](https://github.com/request/request)
```
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```

**Notes**: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
